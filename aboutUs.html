        <p>
          ESG (Engineering Student Government) is the student run
          government for engineers at the University of Michigan. We ensure
          that students have a voice on campus, whether they have a concern or
          they would like to join one of our committees. Our responsibilities
          range from providing funding for student groups to hosting
          campus events.

      <h1>ESG Mission</h1> 

     <div class='pure-u-1-1'>
        <p>
          ESG will work directly to improve the student experience in the University of Michigan College of Engineering through our own initiatives and supporting the initiatives of others seeking to do the same.  We will hear the voice of the student body and advocate for it to the College Administration and University.
