## The Process

Here is the process for how ESG is involved when funding an event.

- A [registered ESG group][] asks for money from ESG by submitting an
  application
- The financial committee reviews the application. If more information is
  needed to make a decision, the financial committee will contact whoever
  submitted the application
- If the financial committee decides to fund the event, money will be
  transferred to the group's SOAS account.
- Group member buys materials for the event.
- Event
- Group member is reimbursed by the group
- Any leftover money is returned to ESG.

## What ESG Doesn't Fund

- Alcohol. Don't even try it -- even if it is catered by the University.
- The same event twice. 'Same' can be ambiguous and is up to the discretion of
  the financial committee
- Transportation. ESG doesn't **normally** fund transportation

## Auditing

ESG's financial committee has one role and one role only: to disperse money to
groups who will make the community a better place (and this implicitly implies
making a budget, which we also do). The funding process is a mix of efficiency
and good faith. ESG funds events in advance so that groups can guarantee
members that they will be reimbursed. This guarantee would not be possible if
ESG only did reimbursements and that could negatively impact events. Any
leftover money from the event should be transferred back to ESG's account, yet
ESG won't follow up if this doesn't happen; choosing to believe any withheld
leftover money will be used to benefit the community in the future. This is a
controversial methodology, but we believe that it is the best one. It allows
for both ESG and the student group not to be caught up in the bureaucracy that
normally encompasses finances.
