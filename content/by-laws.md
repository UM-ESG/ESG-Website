# Article IX: MEMBER SOCIETY PROBATION/SUSPENSION

## Section 1:

Society status will be defined as Good, Probation, or Suspension.

A society will be given a status for a term of one semester, based on a society’s ESG involvement for the previous semester. At the end of each semester, societies will be notified by the Vice President of their status for the following semester within two weeks of the last General Body Meeting of the current semester. Throughout the semester, it is the society’s responsibility to ensure their fulfillment of the obligations set forth in Article VIII: MEMBER SOCIETY OBLIGATIONS. A semester is defined as an academic term (Fall and Winter) as scheduled by the Registrar.

Societies in Good standing will have use of all ESG services. If a society fulfills all obligations stated in Article VIII during the current semester, the society will be placed in Good standing for the following semester. If a society does not fulfill these obligations, the society will be placed on Probation for the following semester.
