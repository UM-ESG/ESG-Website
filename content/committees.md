## Funding

The funding committee is responsible for:

- Drafting the UMEC budget
- Reviewing and approving allocations
- Fulfilling the financial needs of other committees

The committee is structured to be small with around a half a dozen members,
who are enthusiastic about making UMEC a financially sound organization and
who meet about once a week for an hour. The director of finance runs the
funding committees
