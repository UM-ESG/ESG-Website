## Funding

The funding committee is responsible for:

- Drafting the UMEC budget
- Reviewing and approving allocations
- Fulfilling the financial needs of other committees

The committee is structured to be small with around a half a dozen members,
who are enthusiastic about making UMEC a financially sound organization and
who meet about once a week for an hour. The director of finance runs the
funding committees.

## Leadership

The leadership committee aims to improve the leadership abilities of the COE.  This is accomplished by holding workshops and other events to educate and promote leadership in the COE.  Committee membership is broken down into:

- Project leaders, who lead the organization of events
- General committee members, who support the organization of events and help project leaders

There is no size limit on the leadership committee.  Meetings occur once every week for one hour and follow an agenda.  The committee is led by the director of leadership.
