## Funding

The funding committee is responsible for:

- Drafting the UMEC budget
- Reviewing and approving allocations
- Fulfilling the financial needs of other committees

The committee is structured to be small with around a half a dozen members,
who are enthusiastic about making UMEC a financially sound organization and
who meet about once a week for an hour. The director of finance runs the
funding committee.

## Leadership

The leadership committee aims to improve the leadership abilities of the COE.  This is accomplished by holding workshops and other events to educate and promote leadership in the COE.  Committee membership is broken down into:

- Project leaders, who lead the organization of events
- General committee members, who support the organization of events and help project leaders

There is no size limit on the leadership committee.  Meetings occur once every week for one hour and follow an agenda.  The committee is led by the director of leadership.

## Honor and Services

The Honors and Service Committee focuses on planning North Campus Service Day and Order of the Engineer. North Campus Service Day is composed of participants heading to different sites to spend the day volunteering and then return for a time of reflection. The Order of the Engineer is a ceremony for students within a semester of graduating or having already graduated to show their commitment to being an ethical engineer. 

Responsibilities of committee members:

- Plan, advertise, and volunteer at mentioned events
- Attend weekly meeting (1 hr/week)
- Respond to emails

The Director of Honors and Service leads the committee. 

Volunteering experience is preferred for potential committee members, though not a prerequisite.

## Publicity

The purpose of the Publicity Committee is to promote UMEC and UMEC events
around campus.  Members of the committee will participate in Festifall,
Northfest, and Winterfest.

Members will be responsible for:

- Designing the flyers, posters, and advertisements used for UMEC events
- Disseminating information prior to the UMEC event

Membership is open to all interested students. The Publicity Committee meets
for one hour per week, and meetings are led by the Publicity Chair.
