## -> Student Sexual Misconduct Policy/Understanding Sexual Misconduct <-

The University’s Student Sexual Misconduct Policy, in accordance with federal law (Title IX), makes it clear that sexual misconduct, violence and harassment are civil rights offenses (see: http://studentsexualmisconductpolicy.umich.edu/).

If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted, confidential support and guidance can be found with the University’s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) and at the Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center (SAPAC). SAPAC can be contacted on their 24-hour crisis line, 734-936-3333. More information is available at caps.umich.edu and sapac.umich.edu.

Alleged violations can be reported non-confidentially to the Office for Institutional Equity (OIE) atinstitutional.equity@umich.edu. While CAPS and SAPAC are confidential spaces, other university-affiliated individuals may have responsibilities to share that information with the university. If you have any questions about who is mandated to report, contact the OIE or SAPAC. In case of an emergency, call 911.
