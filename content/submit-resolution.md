# Submit a Resolution 

To submit a resolution to the ESG Senate please follow the following steps: 

1. Look at [past resolutions](resolutions.html) to make sure something similar hasn't already been submitted.
2. Look at the [resolution template](https://drive.google.com/a/umich.edu/file/d/0B5rLjuBuFleUSl9iUGNJOE5hbUE/view?usp=sharing) to correctly format your resolution.
3. Email ESG's executive board at [esg.executive@umich.edu](mailto:esg.executive@umich.edu?) to schedule a senate meeting to present your resolution

Please note that all resolutions should be co-authored by atleast one ESG senate member. Feel free to reach out to any member of the [ESG Senate](senate.html).
