2. Parliamentary Procedure Overview
	- Discussion regarding last two points:
		+ "Voting may only proceed if the motion has been seconded and **no objections are made**"
		+ "Objections may be overruled by two thirds vote if abused"
	- Intended to curb useless objections that waste time
	- First point above change to **"no unresolved objections"**
	- "Who is a member of the council"
		+ Board response: Selected representative of the organization // at large students
		+ It is possible to achieve tenured council status for non representatives through attendance at 2 of any 3 consecutive meetings or the first meeting (By­laws Article 1 section 2)
		+ "Who is a member of the council"
			* Board response: There is no precedent so this will therefore be considered the first meeting with respect to tenure as well as to organization membership

5. Budget Review
	- Breakdown and Explanation: Money comes from student government fees, every semester, open to corporate donations.  Also typically $15,000 from COE given approved budget.  Balance after the semester rising from ~1500 to 6000 since most events were neglected due to board turnover etc.  Large reduction in budget is again due to board turnover and short timespan before end of semester.
