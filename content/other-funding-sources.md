# Funding Guidelines

There are many, many groups on campus that provide funding to student initiatives. In some cases, ESG will choose not to fund a request simply because funds are not available for very large requests. In any case, ESG receives many requests that would be funded by [CSG][] and the [College of Engineering Office of Student Affairs][] as well. An exhaustive list of campus funding sources is maintained by the [Center for Campus Involvement][].
